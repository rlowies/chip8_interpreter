# chip8_interpreter in c++

The chip8 is a processor originally used in the Cosmac VIP and Telmac 1800 microcomputers in the 1970's.
I chose to write this interpreter as a challenge to myself and out of pure interest in emulation. 


### Bugs

Some games run great but there are a few issues, and at this time not all opcodes are programmed. However the cpu is operational as a proof of concept.

### Conclusion

This was the first project I wrote under the C++ language. I have experience in C and that helped a lot, a microprocessors course aided my understanding of opcode operations and a Programming Languages course was the foundation to my interpretation knowledge. Without these classes I would not have been able to understand the process.
